## Tools

This is a space where I share my favorite tools that I use every day for development and just day-to-day productivity

I rely on a **MacBook Pro** (M3 Pro) and an Android phone (**Samsung Galaxy S23**).

### Coding

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my editor of choice. Some of my favorite extensions:
  - [**Rainglow**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daylerees.rainglow): My favorite theme just because of the variety it provides. I‚Äôm one of those monsters who enjoy coding in light mode, so my personal favorite is Glance Light
  - [**Wrap Console Log**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=midnightsyntax.vscode-wrap-console-log): Just for quick `console.log` all day long.
  - [**VS Sequential Number**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neptunedesign.vs-sequential-number): Does what it says on the tin. Comes in handy more than you think.
  - [**Remote - SSH**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh): For using VSCode on a remote machine. As someone who likes self-hosting, this is indispensable.
  - [**Code Spell Checker**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker): Because it‚Äôs so annoying to misspell something in your code. It follows you forever.
  - [**Auto Rename Tag**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag): Never have to worry about closing your HTML/JSX tags.
- [**Warp**](https://www.warp.dev/): A terminal that is unlike anything else. Feels like an extension of a code editor rather than a terminal.
- [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/): for testing and debugging APIs. I especially like chaining requests. A feature I can‚Äôt find anywhere else
- [**Proxyman**](https://proxyman.io/): For mocking and inspecting HTTP traffic.

### General Apps

- [**Microsoft Edge**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge): My browser of choice for now. I love the horizontal tabs which can be auto-hidden and the side panel for mini web apps.
- [**Raycast**](https://www.raycast.com/): A Swiss army knife for everything MacOS. It‚Äôs a replacement for Spotlight that can do so much more. It‚Äôs impossible to get into everything here, but you must check it out.
- [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/): For note-taking. This website is based on Notion so you know I like it. I would love it if they would deliver on their promise of a Google Calendar integration.
- [**Spark**](https://sparkmailapp.com/): For email management. If you like the idea of ‚Äúinbox zero‚Äù, this will get you there.
- [**Todoist**](https://todoist.com/): Task management. I love how intuitive it is and love creating tasks with natural language reminders. You can just type ‚ÄúDo laundry tomorrow at 10‚Äù and you‚Äôre set.
- [**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/): My password manager of choice. Does everything I expect while being very cheap. The UI could use some revamping though.
