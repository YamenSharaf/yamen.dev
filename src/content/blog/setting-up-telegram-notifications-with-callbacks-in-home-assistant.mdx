I'm not a Telegram user by any means, I don't use it for casual texting with friends. I don't keep up with any events or join any groups.It's not quite secure enough for that anymore anyways. However, it still is my favorite notification system for the following reasons:
- Persistence. History stays where it is, you can go back to any message and find its date and time for future reference.
- Richness. Telegram notifications can contain text, images, links and videos. Your text can even be formatted to look nice depending on the context.
- Broadcast. Telegram notifications can be sent to an individual or a group, which means you can set up a notification that reaches the entire household.
- Actionable. Notifications can be associated with actions, A notification can come with relevant action for you to take, leveraging the inline keyboard feature, which the subject of this article.

In this article, I'll rebuild a favorite Home Assistant Automation of mine, it boils down to the following steps:

- Detects when I'm away from home
- Ask me if I want to turn on "Vacation Mode". In this mode, certain light automations are disabled and heating is turned off.
- If I confirm that I am "On Vacation", the automation will proceed to turn this toggle on.
- A subsequent message is sent confirming the action has been taken. This message will contain options which will allow me to revert the action

In reality, this automation, also does the opposite when it detects that I'm back close to home, but I don't think that I need two examples of the same things. Here it is in action:

![After vacation](@assets/images/ha-telegram-callback/ha_telegram_callback_auto_after_vacation.png)

## Assumptions
To limit the scope of this article, I'm making the following assumption about the reader:
- You are somewhat familiar with Home Assistant automations
- You have already set up the [Telegram integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/telegram/) and a [Telegram Bot](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/telegram_bot/), which is needed for this automation.
- You have the [Proximity Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/proximity) set up. This is not necessary since you can use whichever trigger the automation using any state that suits your particular use-case. Only needed if you want to set up this particular automation.

Alright! now that we've laid down the work needed, let's break it down!

## Setting up the conditions
### Detect when I'm Away From Home
1. In a new automation screen, let's start with our first condition using `Add condition -> Entity -> Numeric State`
2. For our entity, I'll add my person entity from the Proximity Integration, in my case it's `person.yamen`
3. I'll choose Above mode, and input 10000 to specify 10 kilometer as a Fixed Number.
4. Using the overflow menu for the trigger, I'll choose `Edit ID`, this is done to keep everything organized in one automation while having multiple triggers. In the new `Trigger ID` field, I will input `on-10km-away`. You can call it anything that suits your need and naming convention.

This is what I ended up with:

Let's move on to the second condition

### Receive Telegram Callback Action
We're still creating triggers here. This is not the "chronological" way of doing this, but I have chosen to go linearly through the automation because I think it's the right way to craft an automation when you have a solid idea in mind, if this doesn't make sense now, I promise it will in an upcoming step.

1. Create a new trigger, this time `Add trigger -> Other triggers -> Manual event.
2. In the Event type field, we'll input `telegram_callback`. This has to be this exact string.
In the `Event data` field, we'll type `command: /set_on_vacation_on`, here you can customize what the command can be called, this is what will be triggered when you choose an action in the Telegram message.
3. You don't need to select a user, but let's give this trigger an ID like we did with the previous trigger, from the overflow menu, `Edit ID`. Let's call this one `on-set-vacation-on-telegram-callback`.

We end up with this

## Setting up Actions
Now that we have our triggers in order, let's scroll down to the **Then do** section to create our actions
1. We'll start with adding a building block so we can differentiate between our two triggers. `Add Building Block -> Choose`. We will set up two conditions and two actions in total corresponding to our two triggers. Let's start with the first one

### First Option: Reacting to Distance from Home
1. Expand `Option 1`. `Add condition -> Other conditions -> Triggered by`. If you did everything correctly so far, you should have two triggers available: `on-10km-away` and `on-set-vacation-on-telegram-callback`. Let's select only the first one (`on-10km-away`), and let's move on to creating our action.

2. Here, I'll set up the initial Telegram message, notifying me that Home Assistant has detected that I am away from home, and prompting me to take action if needed. In the `Add action` dialog, I'll search for `Telegram bot: Send message`. If you don't see this action, it means you haven't set up your Telegram Bot integration correctly. Let's choose it.
