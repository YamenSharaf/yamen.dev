[Umami](https://umami.is/) is an open-source, privacy-focused web analytics tool that serves as an alternative to Google Analytics. It provides essential insights into website traffic, user behavior, and performance, all while prioritizing data privacy.
For this website analytics, I'm hosting Umami on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/dashboard).

Instructions for hosting Umami on Fly.io can be found [here](https://umami.is/docs/guides/running-on-fly-io).
